								<h3><span class="image right"><img src="images/firstgold.jpg" alt="" style="width: 300px; height: 250px;" /></span> First Gold Medal</h3>
									<p style="text-align:left"> I won my first gold medal in grade 6, when my team won the city championships. I played girls doubles and was one of the captains of the team.

								<h3><span class="image right"><img src="images/ofssa.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;"/></span> OFSAA </h3>
									<p style="text-align:left"> It was an honour to represent my school at the OFSAA championships. It had been a goal of mine to be able to compete at the provincial level, and I was able to win the gold medal in C flight with my girls doubles partner.

								<h3><span class="image right"><img src="images/newventure.jpg" alt="" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;"/></span> M.V.P. Awards</h3>

								<h3><span class="image right"><img src="images/teamgold.jpg" alt="" style="width: 320px; height: 250px;"/></span> Team Gold</h3>
									<p style="text-align:left"> Not only is it important to me to succeed individually, I take great pride in succeeding as a team. I like to lead my team and help members improve their skills. To the right is a photo of our high school team winning team overall gold, girls' overall gold, and mixed overall gold - a day my team and I will never forget!
