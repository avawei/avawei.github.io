								<h3> Server/Cashier Experience </h3>
									<p style="text-align:left"> <span class="image right"><img src="images/lascoop.png" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 250px;"/></span>
									I held a job for two summers when I was in high school at an ice cream kiosk. As only one person worked at the kiosk at a time, I handled all tasks simultaneously and independently. I served ice cream, sold drinks, worked the cash register, and handled any deliveries of new stock. I was responsible for opening the kiosk and setting up, as well as closing at the end of each day after counting and balancing the sales money. Through this job, I learned how to work under pressure and multi-task. I also developed customer service experience and further enhanced my organizational skills.
