								<h3> Accounts Payable Experience</h3>
									<p style="text-align:left"> <span class="image right"><img src="images/nameplate.jpg" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 250px;" /></span> After four months of working as an Accounts Payable Intern, I was called by my supervisor to return for the following summer. I was glad to return as I enjoyed working in the Accounting department surrounded by kind and hardworking individuals. Here are some of the things I was responsible for at my job: <br /> <br />
										-	Processed manual and purchase order invoices with strong accuracy <br />
										-	Ensured invoices were properly coded and approved before sending out payment <br /> 
										-	Prevented delays in payment by double checking all addresses, unsigned cheques, invoice numbers, and dollar amounts <br /> 
										-	Reviewed for misapplied payments and other inconsistencies before mailing out cheques, while making sure of the correct stamps <br /> 
										-	Provided timely updates to supervisor when performing assigned tasks <br /> 
										-	Quickly and accurately performed data entry <br /> 
										-	Checked and fixed discrepancies while entering invoices into Sage 300 ERP (AccPac) <br /> 
										-	Efficiently matched invoices to 150+ cheques in one sitting <br /> 
										-	Maintained files for 4 different company databases in both open payable cabinets and paid cabinets <br />

								<h3> Server/Cashier Experience </h3>
									<p style="text-align:left"> <span class="image right"><img src="images/lascoop.png" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 250px;"/></span>
									I held a job for two summers when I was in high school at an ice cream kiosk. As only one person worked at the kiosk at a time, I handled all tasks simultaneously and independently. I served ice cream, sold drinks, worked the cash register, and handled any deliveries of new stock. I was responsible for opening the kiosk and setting up, as well as closing at the end of each day after counting and balancing the sales money. Through this job, I learned how to work under pressure and multi-task. I also developed customer service experience and further enhanced my organizational skills.
