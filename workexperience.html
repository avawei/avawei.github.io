									<p style="text-align:left"> After four months of working as an Accounts Payable Intern, I was called by my supervisor to return for the following summer. I was glad to return as I enjoyed working in the Accounting department surrounded by kind and hardworking individuals. Here are some of the things I was responsible for at my job:
>	Processed PO and manual invoices with strong accuracy
>	Ensured invoices were properly coded and approved before sending out payment
>	Prevented delays in payment by double checking all addresses, unsigned cheques, invoice numbers, and dollar amounts
>	Quickly and accurately performed data entry
>	Checked and fixed discrepancies while entering invoices into Sage 300 ERP (AccPac)
>	Efficiently matched invoices to 150+ cheques in one sitting
>	Filed documents for 4 different company databases in both open payable cabinets and paid cabinets
>	Assisted with implementing improvements to operations of the AP team by helping with organization of filing system
>	Worked in an efficient manner while staying well organized on top of 4 different company databases in both Canada and the U.S.

									<p style="text-align:left">I held a job for two summers when I was in high school at an ice cream kiosk. As only one person worked at the kiosk at a time, I handled all tasks simultaneously and independently. I sold drinks and served ice cream, worked the cash register, and handled any deliveries of new stock. I was responsible for opening the stand and setting up, as well as closing at the end of each day after counting and balancing the sales money. Through this job, I learned how to work under pressure and multi-task. I also developed customer service experience and further enhanced my organizational skills. <br /> </p>
